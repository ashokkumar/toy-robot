Design decisions:-
------------------

I came up with the following domain objects:-

- TableTop
- Robot
- Location
- Direction
- Coordinate


I came up with the `location` object as I felt that will reduce the coupling between the `robot` and `tabletop` and also it will wrap the the `coordinate` and `direction` as one single interface to `robot`.


- Simulator

Simulator is more of an orchestrator with all the domain objects and handle the input and output.
